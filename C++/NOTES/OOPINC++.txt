Like java, C++ uses the class to support object-based programming 
	- However there is significant additional syntax because of C++'s attempt to make class types look exactly like primitive types

	-In C++, top level classes, cannot be declared with any visibility specifier 
	- Also notice that the class declaration in C++ ends with a semicolon. 
	- Instead of supplying a visibility modifier for each member, we simply provide
	  visibility modifiers for sections of the class
	- In Java constructors can invoke each other using a call to this. In C++, this is not allowed
	- The First alternative is to use default parameters in the constructor
