		- Basic differences between JAVA Compiler and C++ File 
			- In C++ there is typically two files associated with code you write
			- A file that gives you the actual implementation and another file that specifies the 
			  basic interface. This interface is stored in a specific file called the header file
			
		- In Java packages are used to have clean namespaces to avoid ambiguioty. Also used for visibility 
		  Control
