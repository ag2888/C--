OO Design 

What are the functional requirements of the project 

How do compilers work ? Take a textual representation and parse into a tree 
representation of the program 
	- Small Example 

	while( x < 2 * y )  {  

		x++; 
	} 

	Abstract Syntax Tree for the above 

while statement node which has child less than node which has the child 
	x the identifier  
	
	Less than has also the child mult 

	mult has the child const and identifier y 
while statement node also has child increment statement 
		- incrementStatement has child identifier x 
	
				
	

	Two different Types of Tree 
		- Abstract Syntax Tree: essential synthatic constructs of the 
					program 
		
	 Nodes that represent individual constructs 

		- concrete 

	OO Design 
		 - CRC cards - Specific responibilities of the class and the 
			       Collolobators 
		- UML Language
